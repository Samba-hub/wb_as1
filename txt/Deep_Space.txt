Beyond the familiar planets of our own solar system lies an ancient,
            vast, and breathtaking universe. This is the realm of deep spaceâ€”a
            place of cosmic wonders whose light has traveled for millions, or
            even billions, of years to reach us. Exploring these objects is like
            looking back in time and witnessing the universe on its grandest and
            most beautiful scale.

Peer across millions of light-years to see entire "island
              universes," each containing billions of suns. With our telescopes,
              you can witness the faint, ethereal glow of the Andromeda Galaxy,
              the closest spiral galaxy to our own, or hunt for even more remote
              galactic clusters far across the cosmos.

Gaze upon colossal clouds of interstellar gas and dust where new
                stars are born and old ones have met their end. These are some
                of the most beautiful objects in the sky. Let us help you view
                the stunning stellar nursery of the Orion Nebula or the iconic,
                towering columns of the Pillars of Creation.

Distant Star Systems and Planets: While seeing exoplanets directly
              is reserved for professional observatories, you can view the very
              stars they are known to orbit, connecting you to thousands of
              other solar systems. You can also resolve ancient, glittering
              balls of hundreds of thousands of stars, known as globular
              clusters, that orbit the core of our galaxy.
