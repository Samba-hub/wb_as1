You don't need a powerful telescope to witness the magic of the
          cosmos. The most ancient and personal observatory has always been with
          you: your own eyes. For thousands of years, people have looked up in
          awe, tracing stories in the stars and tracking the planets as they
          wander across the sky. This page is dedicated to that timeless
          tradition of stargazing.

Even distant families of stars are within your reach. Look for the
            faint, misty patch of the Pleiades (the Seven Sisters), a stunning
            star cluster that has captivated stargazers for centuries.Constellations:
            Learn to connect the dots and find legendary figures like Orion the
            Hunter or use the Big Dipper to navigate your way to the North Star.
            The sky is a storybook, and we can help you read it.

The Moon: Observe its phases as it waxes and wanes each month. On a
            clear night, you can even trace the dark plains, or maria, that form
            the "man in the moon."Bright Planets: Discover how to
            distinguish the steady, brilliant light of planets from the twinkle
            of distant stars. You can easily spot the commanding presence of
            Jupiter, the reddish glow of Mars, or the dazzling appearance of
            Venus as the "Evening Star."
